# 🚀 Projects

This repository is a growing collection of my personal coding projects.  
Each folder contains a separate project — small, big, experimental, or educational.

## 🗂️ How This Repository Is Organized

- Each project lives in its own folder
- Folder names follow this pattern:  
  `Project [number] - Project Name`  
  Example: `Project 1 - My Favorite Animal`

- Projects are added in the order I complete them

- Or scroll through the **commit history** to see what was added
